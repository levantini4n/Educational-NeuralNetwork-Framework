It should be noted however that the framework is currently using the central difference theorem rather than actual back propagation

# Helper Material

Clueless about how neural networks work? Use the Manim animation engine to get an `mp4` out of the Python code in *scene/nn.py* illustrating the neural network implemented in *example.zig*.

If you are on NixOS, and using flakes, just:
1. `cd scene`
2. `nix develop`
3. Follow instructions that get printed out to the terminal
